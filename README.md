# Multiplayer-FPS-Game-Template
 My first time try to code a multiplayer first person shooter game using unity and photon Pun 2


The project is using unity 2022.3.17f1 
The asset used are free asset on sketchfab.com and unity asset store

There're many bugs that i don't have the time to fix. if you find this interesting you could download it and change whatever you like
